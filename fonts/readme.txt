I spammed a lot of the following fonts. 
I'm not sure if I spammed all of them, but I'm pretty sure I spammed m41, m42, and m39 a lot. 
Maybe even more. I really don't know.

In any case, please install them when creating this so that the graphics don't get all messed up. 
If there are any missing, please download from the respective link: http://mfs.jp.org/
If the missing fonts aren't from that website, fuck.
